# Just an idea right now
Its a Saturday and here we are thinking of different things I can code. 
I have this idea for an audio vizualizer that represents music the way i hear it in my head. The way 
I vizualize it in my head.

# The low end
I want there to be a sort of color spectrum. The low end frequencies can hold cooler colors. 
Perhaps purple or blue for the low end kick drums and basses.

# The high end
Since I'm thinking about techno and house music, the thing to do here would present some hot colors. Since that's
usually what i think about when i think of high frequencies. 
I would like to think that I could make a visualizer that would pinpoint the directions of the hats. 
So if you're listening in stereo, the hi hat you hear on your left side would be visually represented on the 
left side, so on and so forth.

# The mid range
This is where the majority of our hearing range is used, and would follow suit with the above examples provided
though I don't exactly care about how this part is represented

# How????
This can most likley be done with the JUCE framework, though I'm not exactly sure, its the only library that comes
to mind when thinking about something like this.

Anyway, just an idea, uploading to github just incase i choose to pursue this...
